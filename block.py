class Block:
    """A square Block in the Blocky game, represented as a tree.

    In addition to its tree-related attributes, a Block also contains attributes
    that describe how the Block appears on a Cartesian plane. All positions
    describe the upper left corner (x, y), and the origin is at (0, 0). All
    positions and sizes are in the unit of pixels.

    When a block has four children, the order of its children impacts each
    child's position. Indices 0, 1, 2, and 3 are the upper-right child,
    upper-left child, lower-left child, and lower-right child, respectively.

    === Public Attributes ===
    position:
        The (x, y) coordinates of the upper left corner of this Block.
    size:
        The height and width of this square Block.
    colour:
        If this block is not subdivided, <colour> stores its colour. Otherwise,
        <colour> is None.
    level:
        The level of this block within the overall block structure.
        The outermost block, corresponding to the root of the tree,
        is at level zero. If a block is at level i, its children are at
        level i+1.
    max_depth:
        The deepest level allowed in the overall block structure.
    children:
        The blocks into which this block is subdivided. The children are
        stored in this order: upper-right child, upper-left child,
        lower-left child, lower-right child.

    === Representation Invariants===
    - len(children) == 0 or len(children) == 4
    - If this Block has children:
        - their max_depth is the same as that of this Block.
        - their size is half that of this Block.
        - their level is one greater than that of this Block.
        - their position is determined by the position and size of this Block,
          and their index in this Block's list of children.
        - this Block's colour is None.
    - If this Block has no children:
        - its colour is not None.
    - level <= max_depth
